## ASCII Art Generator
This repository contains a Python script that generates large, stylized representations of alphabet letters (A–Z) using ASCII art. Each letter is printed with creative spacing and structure to visually represent the character on the console.

## How It Works
When you run the script, it prompts you to enter a name or word, and then prints each character using custom ASCII art functions. Every character from A to Z has its own dedicated rendering function.

## How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed, then run the script like this:
```
python Text-to-ASCII-art.py

```

Or replace Text-to-ASCII-art.py with your actual file name if it's different.

## Project Structure
The script includes:

* A function for each letter from A to Z (e.g., print_A(), print_B(), ... print_Z()).

* A main loop that takes a string input from the user and prints each character's ASCII representation line by line.

* Line breaks between each character for better visual separation.

This structure makes it easy to expand or customize how characters are displayed.

## Example Output
Here’s what you might see when you input the word TANJIM:
