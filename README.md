# ASCII Art Generator

This repository contains Python functions designed to generate and display various characters and symbols using ASCII art. Each function creates a large, stylized version of its respective output, printed directly to the console.

## How to Use

To run the code and see the ASCII art generated, simply execute the Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python tanjim.py
```

Replace tanjim.py with the actual name of your Python file if it's different.

## Project Structure 
The core of this project consists of individual Python functions, each responsible for rendering a specific ASCII art character. This modular approach makes it easy to add new characters in the future.

## Available Art Pieces (Current Examples)
While this project is designed to be expandable, here are some examples of the ASCII art you can generate with the current version of the code:

* Letter 'T': A bold representation of the letter T.
* Letter 'A': A detailed rendering of the letter A.
* Letter 'N': The letter N with a distinctive pattern.
* Letter 'J': A unique presentation of the letter J.
* Letter 'I': A simple yet clear depiction of the letter I.
* Letter 'M': The letter M with a striking design.

## Example Output
Below is a combined representation of what the script might output when executed. Due to the nature of ASCII art, the actual output in your terminal will be larger and more visually distinct.
